# TODO List

1. **Add Ensemble Attack**

   - Integrate ensemble attack into all attack benchmarks.

2. **Implement Defensive Mechanisms**

   - Develop and implement defensive mechanisms for the models.

3. **Add Missing Models**

   - After completing the above tasks:
     - Check for fine-tuned models.
     - If unavailable, train models from scratch.

4. **Download Remaining Datasets**

   - Ensure all datasets are downloaded.
   - Apply the above tasks to all models across the four datasets.

5. **Compare and Contrast**

   - Perform a detailed comparison and analysis of results.

6. **Develop and Test New Methods**
   - Develop new and improved attack and defense methods.
   - Test the new attack and defense methods for effectiveness.

7. **Make csv output columns uniform 
   - use the same samples per class
   - add sample per class column (instead of num sample(total sample))
   - add accuracy drop
